## 🐣 About This Project

This is a **beginner-friendly timer project** I built to practice GUI programming in Python.
It helped me learn how to:

* Create custom UI elements with `tkinter`
* Work with `after()` to create live countdowns
* Add custom fonts, colors, and background images
* Handle state changes like pause and resume
